## 📖 <big>Overview</big>

<p align="justify">
Bypass Steam's strict upload restrictions for Workshop and Artwork showcases. This repository provides two specialized tools: one for <b>frame-perfect splitting</b> of Workshop animations and another for the <b>Hex Patcher</b> patch to enable "infinite" height artworks.
</p>

> [!TIP]
> This tool automates that tedious process for multiple files at once, eliminating the need for manual hex editors.

## ✨ <big>The Tools</big>

### 1️⃣ Workshop Splitter (`WorkshopSplitter.bat`)
* **Automatic Resizing:** Scales your GIF to **800x450** resolution.
* **5-Way Split:** Perfectly crops your GIF into 5 segments (158px width) with the exact 2px margins required for a seamless Steam Workshop look.
* *Note: Requires `ffmpeg.exe` in the folder.*

### 2️⃣ Steam Artwork GHP (`SteamArtworkGHP.bat`)
* **The "Hex patch":** Automatically changes the final byte from `0x3B` to `0x21`.
* **Context Aware:** If it detects a `workshop_output` folder, it patches those files automatically. Otherwise, it patches GIFs in the current directory.
* **Non-Destructive:** Saves final versions to a `patched_gifs` subfolder.

## 🚀 <big>How to Use</big>

To ensure the best quality under Steam's **5MB limit**, follow these steps:

1.  **Download:** Get the latest version from Releases (or copy the code and make a bat file yourself) **IMPORTANT NOTE:** ffmpeg.exe is required to be in the same folder as WorkshopSplitter.bat for it to work properly.
2.  **Split:** Run `WorkshopSplitter.bat` to generate the 5 raw segments in the `/workshop_output` folder.
3.  **Optimize:** If any of your gifs are over 5 MB, take those GIFs to an optimizer (like [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/optimize)) to ensure each is under 5MB. 
4.  **Patch:** Run `SteamArtworkGHP.bat`. It will detect your files and apply the Hex patch.
5.  **Upload:** Use the browser console scripts below to upload the gifs to your Steam.
