## 📖 <big>Overview</big>

<p align="justify">
When uploading GIFs to Steam profiles, the platform often enforces strict aspect ratio and height limits. By modifying the final byte of a GIF file from <code>0x3B</code> (the standard GIF trailer) to <code>0x21</code> (an extension block), you can bypass these restrictions to create <b>"infinite" or long-format artworks</b>.
</p>

> [!TIP]
> This tool automates that tedious process for multiple files at once, eliminating the need for manual hex editors.

## ✨ <big>Features</big>

* 🚀 **No Installation Required:** Uses a Batch-PowerShell hybrid that runs natively on Windows 10/11.
* 📦 **Batch Processing:** Patches all GIFs in a folder simultaneously.
* 🛡️ **Non-Destructive:** Creates an `/output` folder so your original files remain untouched.
* 🏷️ **Automatic Renaming:** Adds a `_hex` suffix to processed files for easy identification.

## 🚀 <big>How to Use</big>

1.  **Download** the `Steamartwork_patcher.bat` file.
2.  **Place** it into the folder containing your exported GIFs.
3.  **Run** the file by double-clicking it.
4.  The script includes a safety prompt. Simply press **Y** to start or **N** to cancel 
5.  Your patched GIFs will be ready in the newly created `output` folder.
6.  Upload to Steam using the corresponding browser console script (READ BELOW). 

### 🛠️ Steam Console Scripts
To bypass the upload validation, paste the corresponding code into your browser console (`F12` > Console) while on the Steam upload page:
<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/edititem/767/3/" target="_blank">🚀 Open Steam Upload Page</a>

**For Long Artwork Showcase:**
```javascript
$J('#image_width').val(1000).attr('id',''),$J('#image_height').val(1).attr('id','');
```
**For Long Workshop Showcases:**
```javascript
$J('[name=consumer_app_id]').val(480);$J('[name=file_type]').val(0);$J('[name=visibility]').val(0);
```
**For Long Guides:**
```javascript
$J('[name=consumer_app_id]').val(480);$J('[name=file_type]').val(9);$J('[name=visibility]').val(0);
```

##  ⚙️ <big>Technical Details</big>

The script reads the binary data of the GIF. In the GIF89a specification, 0x3B marks the end of the file. By changing it to 0x21, the Steam upload validator ignores certain dimension checks while the browser still renders the GIF correctly.

    Logic: Binary Stream Modification

    Core: Windows Batch & PowerShell Core integration
